# Beverage Container Detection Using YOLO


This project demonstrates how to train, validate, and use a **YOLOv11** model to **detect** 
**beverage containers** using a dataset from **Roboflow**. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-
the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time 
applications.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a robust YOLOv11 model capable of detecting beverage 
containers in images. By leveraging Roboflow for dataset preparation and YOLOv11 for training, 
the project achieves high accuracy in detecting various types of containers.



## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Roboflow, containing labeled images of beverage containers. The dataset includes training, validation, and test sets for optimal model performance.

**Key Details:**

* **Number of Classes:** Multiple beverage container types.

* **Image Resolution:** 640x640 (optimized for YOLOv11).

* **Format:** YOLO-specific annotations.


To download the dataset, we used the following Roboflow API integration:

```python
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
project = rf.workspace("roboflow-universe-projects").project("beverage-containers-3atxb")
version = project.version(3)
dataset = version.download("yolov11")
```



## Setup and Installation

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install roboflow ultralytics

2. Integrate the dataset using the Roboflow API and download the YOLOv11 configuration file.

3. Ensure the YOLOv11 environment is ready:
